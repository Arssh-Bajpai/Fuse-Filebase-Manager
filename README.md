## Fuse Filebase Manager

### Overview
The **Fuse Filebase Manager** is a **file management system** designed to provide efficient, secure, and scalable file storage and retrieval solutions. It leverages a **database-driven architecture** to handle structured file metadata, enabling seamless file organization, indexing, and retrieval.

### Features
- **File Storage & Organization** – Manage files with metadata tagging and categorization.
- **Indexing & Search** – Quickly locate files using an optimized query system.
- **User Access Control** – Implement role-based permissions for file access.
- **Scalability** – Designed to handle large volumes of files and metadata.
- **Integration with Cloud Storage** – Supports integration with services like AWS S3, Google Drive, or private servers.

### Technologies Used
- **MongoDB** (NoSQL database for storing file metadata)
- **Python / Flask** (Backend API for file management)
- **FastAPI** (Alternative backend option for performance)
- **React.js / Vue.js** (Frontend UI for managing files)
- **Docker** (Containerization for deployment)
- **Cloud Storage APIs** (AWS S3, Google Drive, etc.)

### Database Schema (Example)
```json
{
  "file_id": "abc123",
  "file_name": "report.pdf",
  "file_type": "application/pdf",
  "uploaded_by": "user123",
  "upload_date": "2025-03-12",
  "tags": ["finance", "Q1-report"],
  "storage_location": "s3://bucket-name/report.pdf",
  "permissions": {
    "read": ["user123", "admin"],
    "write": ["admin"]
  }
}
```

### Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fuse-Filebase-Manager
   cd Fuse-Filebase-Manager
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn pymongo boto3
   ```
3. Run the API server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
4. To upload a file via API:
   ```python
   import requests
   files = {'file': open('sample.pdf', 'rb')}
   response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/upload", files=files)
   print(response.json())
   ```
5. Future versions can include a **React-based UI** for enhanced user experience.

### Future Improvements
- **Full-text search capabilities** using Elasticsearch.
- **File versioning & rollback system** for historical tracking.
- **Integration with enterprise authentication systems** (OAuth, SSO).
- **Advanced analytics** on file usage and access patterns.
